# 🧭 Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive Python application to visualize popular pathfinding algorithms like A*, Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS on a 2D grid. Built with **Pygame**, this tool demonstrates how different algorithms explore and find the shortest path in a maze-like environment.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔹 Visualize algorithms step-by-step
- 🔹 Supports:  
  - A* (A-Star)  
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm  
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)  
- 🔹 Create custom start, end, and wall nodes
- 🔹 Generate random walls
- 🔹 Clean UI with real-time animation using Pygame
